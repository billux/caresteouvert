> Can't find your usual bakery or pharmacy on «Ça reste ouvert» (English: 'It remains open') ? Don't worry, follow the guide to help improve our collaborative map of accessible places during confinement.

«Ça reste ouvert» is based on OpenStreetMap(OSM) data. It's something like a “Wikipedia of maps”: a map of the world that you can enrich based on your local knowledge of your neighborhood, and places you're familiar with.

And that's what we're going to do: improve the map to add this missing establishment!

### First step: create an account

Before starting, you need to create an account on the [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) site.

Register on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://osm.org/user/new)

This step is essential to join the community, enable you to modify the map, and also interact with other contributors.

### Second step: modify the area
You can then navigate to OpenStreetMap.org in the same way while it stays open or explore other areas in your neighborhood.

Zoom into where you want to add an establishment, then click the **Edit** button at the top left.

On your first time to use OpenStreetMap, a short guide will explain the main things you need to know on how to contribute. We recommend that you follow it to the end to familiarize yourself with the contribution process, while we will only focus on the **Points** section to add our missing establishment.

### Third step: Create the establishment

To create a missing place, click on the click on the **“Point”**, button move the pointer to the correct position, and click the mouse button.

Then, using the search field on the left of your screen, fill-in the type of business you want to create. For example, a "pharmacy."

> If you wish to add a franchised business or business chain , you can also search for the brand name (for example “Mercury Drug” or “Walgreens”)

### Fourth step: add useful information

Fill in information about this business, such as its name or phone number.

You don't have to fill out the entire form if you can't remember the details. Add only what you know, and avoid guessing. If you forget the restaurant name leave it blank, it's alright.

###  Step five: save your changes

When you are done, the next thing to do is save the changes by clicking on the button at the top right of the screen.

Add a short comment to indicate what you have changed on the map, then click on the “Send” button.

### That's it!

Congratulations on this first contribution, and welcome to the OpenStreetMap community!

All you have to do is wait: new shops are added regularly and automatically in '«Ça reste ouvert». You can then indicate any additional information useful during the lockdown time, directly on the site.


##### Reminders

Before creating your missing business, carefully examine the existing places: it may already be there, but with a different type.

OpenStreetMap is a public map: do not enter any personal data concerning yourself or the merchants you add.

Do not copy information from other maps, they are generally protected by copyright.
