Please read https://github.com/caresteouvert/caresteouvert/wiki/Expand-%22%C3%87a-reste-ouvert%22-to-another-country first.

Please check the following requirements:

- [ ] You are a team of at least 2 people experienced with OpenStreetMap
- [ ] Translate the app via transifex with your country languages
- [ ] Translate some content of the blog to help newcomers (how to create a new shop, the about page, ...)
- [ ] Start gathering data about chain stores open or closed nation wide, and legal opening rules in https://github.com/PanierAvide/Covid_enseignes/
- [ ] Once everything has been done and the data have been loaded, you should be busy getting media coverage. So the map will have a lot of contribution and be quickly useful.

Others questions:

- if you want a localized domain name, please tell us which one: 
- Each lockdown is different, what shops are open or closed in your country? What should be done in the category list?
